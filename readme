This program is a simple shell interface written by Dexter Norris.
It must be run on a linux machine and compiled using the "make" 
command with the included makefile. This program has the following
abilities:
1. Ability to change directories to both relative and absolute paths.
2. The ability to execute basic commands such as "sleep","ls","exit" etc.
3. The ability to use text editors such as vim and nano and manipulate text files.
4. The ability to run tasks in the background using "bg".

My simple shell operates similar to a standard bash shell although it has less implementations.
It does not have the ability to show what background tasks are running yet.
Please enjoy my simple shell.
